The Git SCM executes certain 'hooks' for various operations. We customize some
of these hooks in our Git repository to provide custom checks and to take
actions such as sending automated emails.

See githooks(5) for information about the semantics of each individual hook.

The gate configuration is stored in the git configuration file. There is the
default [gate] section optional [gate "base"] sections where top-level sub-
directory configuration can be stored. This allows different top-level sub-
directories to behave slightly differently in terms of the checks required and
the notification lists. The required fields are marked with a *.

[gate]
	name*		The name of the gate (must match the directory name)
	notify*		The email address[es] to which notification is sent
	shortname	An identifier for pushes to the gate
	approvers	The reviewboard approver group required for pushes
	user-check	Set to 'skip' to allow non-git user pushes
	commit-check	Set to 'skip' to allow multiple commits per push
	comment-check	Set to 'skip' to allow free-form (non-bug) comments
	review-check	Set to 'skip' to allow unreviewed pushes

	mail-debug	[debug-only] Print email subjects, but don't send
	bug-update	[debug-only] Set to 'skip' to not close bugs on push

[gate "base"]
	shortname	An alternate identifier for this base
	notify*		The email address[es] to which notification is sent
	user-check	Set to 'skip' to allow non-git user pushes
	commit-check	Set to 'skip' to allow multiple commits per push
	comment-check	Set to 'skip' to allow free-form (non-bug) comments
	review-check	Set to 'skip' to allow unreviewed pushes

	bug-update	[debug-only] Set to 'skip' to not close bugs on push
